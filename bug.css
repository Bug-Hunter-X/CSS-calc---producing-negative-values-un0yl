The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there's a common error where the calculation results in a negative value, but the CSS property doesn't allow negative values. For example, setting the `width` to `calc(100% - 200px)` might result in a negative value if the container's width is less than 200px, which causes unexpected behavior.
